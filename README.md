To get started with this application, please follow these steps:

1- Install the required npm packages by running "npm install" in your terminal.

2- Create an appropriate .env file. A .env.sample has been provided for your convenience. You can rename this file to ".env" and modify the necessary values as per your requirements.

3- Start the application by running "npm start" in your terminal. If you want to run the test cases, you can use the command "npm test".

4- If you want to start a local server, please create a MongoDB on Atlas and provide the necessary access and details in the .env file. This will enable you to test and run the application on your local server.

5- Note that test cases can be run without the Atlas MongoDB, but if you want to use a local MongoDB instance, you will need to modify the values in the .env file accordingly.
